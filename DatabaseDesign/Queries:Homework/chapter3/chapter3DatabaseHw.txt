Find the company that has the smallest payroll
make sure I can do a sum of something in one table but not in the other
regardless if we selected it in the from clause

the subquery in the from clause gets the companies total payroll expense
and then uses this value to compare against later on
against the subquery that is created in the last where clause

the subquery in the where clause does the same thing as the from clause

the only difference is the one in the from clause also selects
company_name so that the parent select clause can grab that for the
final output to create the final relation
