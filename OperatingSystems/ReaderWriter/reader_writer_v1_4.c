//Program Comment: This program demonstrates the reader writer problem. It puts a reader preference spin on the issue so that if a reader has a lock on the resource, the writer cannot read the resource but more readers can read the resouce.

//most of the reader writer code came from here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readersâ€“writers_problem
//this site helped me write the main file: http://www.codingdevil.com/2014/04/c-program-for-reader-writer-problem.html by Umesh Toke
//I used the man page in the terminal to help me with pthread_create and to put the correct parameters
//This site helped with with declaring semaphores: http://www.csc.villanova.edu/~mdamian/threads/posixsem.html

//a good semaphore explanation found here: https://www.cs.mtu.edu/~shene/NSF-3/e-Book/SEMA/basics.html
//pthread_create explanation found at: http://www.amparo.net/ce155/thread-ex.html
//The pthread_create function is used to create new threads. It accepts a thread variable, a thread attribute, a start routine function, and an optional argument. To use default thread attributes, pass NULL as the second argument.
//After the thread has been succesfully created, it starts execution at the indicated start routine function. What is passed to the function is not the function name, but the address of the function type casted as a void pointer.
//Arguments can be passed to the thread using the fourth parameter to pthread_create. Again, a void pointer to the argument is passed. This void pointer should later be type casted back to its true type within the thread routine.

//The following variables are the semaphores that are used to help with the critical section and race condition issues
