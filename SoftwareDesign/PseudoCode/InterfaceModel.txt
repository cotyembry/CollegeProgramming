//Pseudo Code for the Email class

buttonSelected(button id that made the selection) {
	switch(the button on the screen that is selected) {
		case "send":
			//create email instance with the values of all of the fields
			//call the sendEmail method and pass the email instance

			if(a network error occurs) {
				//display error message
				//call the writeEmail method to restart the process
			}
			//otherwise we are done here; continue with the flow

		case "save":
			//create email instance with the values of all of the fields
			//create an instance of the server class
			//pass the email instance to the server class with the save method of the server class
			//display saved successful popup

		case "cancel":
			if(cancel button selected is not the move email selected cancel button) {
				//discard email message
			}
			else {
				//we are done with this flow, let the application be done with this switch statement and get to the control flow below it
			}

		case "home":
			//create email instance with the values of all of the fields
			//create an instance of the server class
			//pass the email instance to the server class with the save method of the server class
			//set reply_selected to false so that the application will go back to the home screen when done with this switch statement

		case "back":
			//create email instance with the values of all of the fields
			//create an instance of the server class
			//pass the email instance to the server class with the save method of the server class

		case "attach":
			//open built in file browser to let the user choose a file to attach

		case "remove attachment":
			//remove all attachments the user may of added

		case "arrow_button":
			//inflate and display over the current screen the MAIL LIST ITEM ITEM POPUP screen defined in the Interface file
			//i.e. reply, forward, move buttons are added to screen

		case "forward":
			//display compose screen in interface file

		case "reply":
			//display compose screen in interface file

		case "move":
			//use server class to get the list of folders that exist
			//display move email selected screen in interface file
			switch(the button on the screen that is selected){
				case
			}
	
	}

		//next is the exit control flow section that executes after the case statement is done
		if(reply_selected private boolean value is true) {
			//return application context back to the email list in the correct folder the user was previously in before selecting reply
		}
		else {
			//return application context back to the home page
