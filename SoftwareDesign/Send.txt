//Pseudo Code for the sending functionality of the software

//******* finish the receive email cases *******


//create an instance of the User class so we can use the data in it in the code below

******* may need to go back and put this into a class definition format because of inheritance *******
//sendEmail() {
	//get data from the fields in the email "form"
	if(email address is filled out in form) {

		if(email address is valid) { //do I even need this line of pseudo code?
			//pass the following to the server to be sent: receipient(s),cc email, bcc email, subject, body, and attachments

			//if sent without error this section of code is done
		}
	} 
	else {
		//print error popup and go back to composing the email (per the state chart diagram)
	}


//} //end of sendEmail()



//receiveEmail() {

	//when application is launched, this function is called to start this process

	//take into account sync setting frequency
	//depending on the sync frequency, scan for the emails on the set frequency


	//if emails are set to always on then the default is to sync every 60 seconds

	switch(sync frequency) {
		//case always on:	while(user is logged in) {
								if(new mail) {
									if(not junk emails) {
										//add emails to inbox folder
									}
									else {
										//add emails to junk folder
									}
								}
								
								//sleep for 60 seconds (this gives the 60 second interval to refresh the emails being sent to the user)
							}
							break;
		//case manual:
