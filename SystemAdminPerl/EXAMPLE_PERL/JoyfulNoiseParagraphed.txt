[VERSE:]

[VERSE:]

Your boy's been a Christian, quite a few years

Victory and faith, but I failed in my fears

I heard a lot of words that have tickled many ears

That's why I praise God for the Word that we adhere

The Word became flesh, lived for thirty years

Died at 33, but after days reappeared

Jesus Christ anointed one ascended in the air

Or you can say the air where the Father made Him heir

Of all things the throne know it's more than a chair

But after our redemption yes He did take a chair

Greater than the angels name superior to theirs

This is Hebrews Chapter 1 if you cared

I'm leaning to the right

The light is where I'm running

I thought I wanted life, drunk, sexed out and blunted

But all I really wanted was the One who really won it

Fought death, beat it gave His life to the public

I love it!



[HOOK:]

[HOOK:]

Angels surrounding His throne and

Worthy is the Lamb who was slain

The whole earth is full of His glory

All nations bow to His name

His majesty fills the Heavens

Our hearts give thunderous praise

Declare the Lord is forever

Make a joyful noise in this place



[VERSE:]

[VERSE:]

Man I'm trying to life Him high

Higher than the stars

I am not of this world like I'm from the planet mars

I love to preach Jesus you can read it in my bars

I'm pretty straight forward when I'm speaking bout my Lord

He paid the sin price being beat by Roman guards

But when He resurrected gave us life free of charge

Now me and my boys need to be in a psych ward

Cause we went crazy for God our lives was scared

Now in the Book of Life, our names have been written down

We're casting our crowns before His feet on the ground

It's such a holy melody and a heavenly sound

Hearing holy holy holy coming out of the mouth

Of the four living creatures by His throne all around

Can you picture the scene this this is how it's going down

You just need a little faith and a new set of eyes and a telescopic lens to look in and see God

I love it!



[HOOK:]

[HOOK:]

Angels surrounding His throne and

Worthy is the Lamb who was slain

The whole earth is full of His glory

All nations bow to His name

His majesty fills the Heavens

Our hearts give thunderous praise

Declare the Lord is forever

Make a joyful noise in this place



[VERSE:]

[VERSE:]

One day we gon' be out man, like three strikes

And home son like a homerun CHRIST

IS – KING – LION – LAMB – GOD – MAN – SIN CONQUEROR – GRAVE CONQUEROR – SATAN CONQURER

Can take a sinner, atheist sinner to God conscience

Can take nothing

Make creation and lives honor

The same God that came through a fetus as Jesus

Limited to breathing

Got believers singing



[HOOK:]

[HOOK:]

Angels surrounding His throne and

Worthy is the Lamb who was slain

The whole earth is full of His glory

All nations bow to His name

His majesty fills the Heavens

Our hearts give thunderous praise

Declare the Lord is forever

Make a joyful noise in this place
